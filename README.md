# Webscraping-with-selenium-and-BeautifulSoup
By selenium I automated the webpage of infinte scrolling and saved as a html file. 
 With the help of Beautiful Soup scraped the data of the webpage and saved it as a .csv file for further analysis.
      All HTML files and .csv files are uploaded for direct analysis and webscraping if you dont need automation.

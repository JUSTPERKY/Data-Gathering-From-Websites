# Data Gathering of Smartprix items and Cryptocurrency 

### This is the First Step of Data Analysis Process called Data Gathering.

 With the help of Beautiful Soup scraped the data of the webpage and saved it as a .csv file for further analysis.
  All HTML files and .csv files are uploaded for direct analysis and webscraping if you dont need automation.
 ## Note : For Both Smartprix and Cryptocurrency website there is infinite scrolling or 'Load more' button by which we can automate the page by finding the XPATH. Hence this XPATH only works for smartprix and coinmaretcap websites only
 
 In cmc.py You can give any other cryptocurrency of your choice and it gives the same dataframe required but to change the Date and Days You can change the count according to your choice 
 #### Note: After loading the page the 'Load More' page of Coinmaretcap usually loads one month or 30 days value of the data so You can set the time according to Your choice and try it.
 
 For smartprix You can do the same just change the url of the smartprix website if You want to extract mobiles or laptops or devices that are available but mind that the body should be the same .
